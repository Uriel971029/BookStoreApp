# JetPack

This is an App example in which is implemented some JetPack components like Room database, DataBinding and LiveData in order to apply the MVVM Architecture.

The concept of the Application is a kind of bookstore, so you can add books and then see them in a list that is refresh from the database. The repository pattern is
applied in the project, so it syncs data from a webservice that is built in PHP, it makes a request to a MySQL database and finally, the response is store with a Room database
in the App.

If you want to launch the App, please let me know sending an email to: marcostrejo152@gmail.com in order to share with you the database file.
